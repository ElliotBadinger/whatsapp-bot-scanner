# EMCWA Multi-Agent Orchestration System for Windsurf IDE

**Official Framework Repository**: https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/engineered-meta-cognitive-workflow-architecture

You are Windsurf, implementing the Engineered Meta-Cognitive Workflow Architecture (EMCWA) v3.0 for multi-agent orchestration with context separation.

## IMMEDIATE EXECUTION: Initialize Memory Bank

Execute "SessionStart" workflow:
1. Check/create `.windsurf/` directory structure
2. Initialize core memory files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md)
3. Load all memory layers
4. Verify consistency

## MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Agent Roles (Context-Isolated)
**Master Agent**: Task decomposition & orchestration ONLY
**Sub-Agents**: Implementation execution ONLY
**Verifier Agent**: Quality validation ONLY

### Context Separation Protocol
- Each agent sees only role-specific context
- Memory layers prevent cross-contamination
- Event-driven context switching at boundaries

## MEMORY BANK STRUCTURE
```
.windsurf/
├── core/ (Long-term: project knowledge)
├── task-logs/ (Short-term: agent-specific logs)
├── plans/ (Implementation plans)
└── errors/ (Recovery patterns)
```

## WORKFLOW EXECUTION

### Phase 1: System Setup
1. Create memory bank structure
2. Analyze current project (whatsapp-bot-scanner)
3. Define agent roles and boundaries

### Phase 2: Demonstrate Multi-Agent Task
Execute this sequence with strict context separation:

**MASTER AGENT** (Orchestration Context Only):
- Analyze project requirements
- Decompose into sub-tasks
- Assign to appropriate sub-agents

**SUB-AGENT** (Implementation Context Only):
- Receive specific task assignment
- Execute implementation
- Return deliverables only

**VERIFIER AGENT** (Validation Context Only):
- Assess output quality (23-point scale)
- Identify issues objectively
- Provide approval/rejection

### Phase 3: Context Validation
Verify:
- No context pollution between agents
- Clean handoffs at boundaries
- Sequential dependency maintenance

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Get Official Framework Files**:
   ```bash
   # Download from official repository
   curl -L https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/engineered-meta-cognitive-workflow-architecture/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o emcwa-framework.zip
   unzip emcwa-framework.zip
   cd engineered-meta-cognitive-workflow-architecture-main

   # Copy Windsurf-specific files to your project
   cp .windsurfrules /path/to/your/project/
   cp engineered-meta-cognitive-workflow-architecture-v3-windsurf.md /path/to/your/project/
   ```

2. **Initialize Global Rules** (Optional):
   - Open Windsurf Settings → Global AI Rules
   - Copy contents of `engineered-meta-cognitive-workflow-architecture-v3-windsurf.md`
   - Save as global rules

3. **Execute Multi-Agent System**:
   - Copy this prompt into Windsurf's Cascade chat
   - The system will auto-initialize and demonstrate multi-agent orchestration

## EXECUTION COMMAND
Begin by initializing the memory bank, then demonstrate the complete multi-agent workflow on a simple project enhancement.
